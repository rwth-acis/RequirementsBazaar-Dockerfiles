# Requirements Bazaar Backend Service

This Dockerfile retrieves the latest version from the continuous integration server on runtime and serves the backend service on port 8080.

# Run from Docker Hub
The image is built automatically on Docker Hub:

https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/rwthacis/reqbaz-service/

To run it, simply call:

`docker run -it -p 8080:8080 rwthacis/reqbaz-service`

# Build it on your own
Of course you can build the image yourself if you don't want to rely on Docker Hub:

1. `git clone https://github.com/rwth-acis/RequirementsBazaar-Dockerfiles.git`
2. `cd RequirementsBazaar-Dockerfiles/reqbaz-service`
3. `docker build -t rwthacis/reqbaz-service .`

# What next?
The backend is great on its own, but what makes it useful is a frontend. To get one, take a look at this GitHub project:
